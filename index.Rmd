# Preface {-}
In this repository I describe R-code that I find useful and occasionally need. I made the documentation for myself, because I quickly forget code that I don't need very often. However, the documentation is public, with the hope that it might be useful for others. 

## How to contribute? {-}
It is open so that everybody with a [GitHub](https://github.com) account can make comments and suggestions for improvement. Readers can contribute in two ways. One way is to add an [issue](https://github.com/TobiasRoth/rdocu/issues). The second way is to contribute content directly through the edit button at the top of the page (i.e. a symbol showing a pencil in a square). That button is linked to the rmarkdown source file of each page. You can correct typos or add new text and then submit a [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). I try to respond to you as quickly as possible. 

## Acknowledgments {-}
I thank *Yihui Xie* for providing [bookdown](bhttps://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) which makes it much fun to write open documentations such as this.
