[["index.html", "Useful R Code Preface How to contribute? Acknowledgments", " Useful R Code Tobias Roth 2021-08-03 Preface In this repository I describe R-code that I find useful and occasionally need. I made the documentation for myself, because I quickly forget code that I don’t need very often. However, the documentation is public, with the hope that it might be useful for others. How to contribute? It is open so that everybody with a GitHub account can make comments and suggestions for improvement. Readers can contribute in two ways. One way is to add an issue. The second way is to contribute content directly through the edit button at the top of the page (i.e. a symbol showing a pencil in a square). That button is linked to the rmarkdown source file of each page. You can correct typos or add new text and then submit a GitHub pull request. I try to respond to you as quickly as possible. Acknowledgments I thank Yihui Xie for providing bookdown which makes it much fun to write open documentations such as this.
